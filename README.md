Ruby wrapper for the Pingdom REST API

==================

Pingdom is a service which monitors whether a website is up or down by pinging it at regular intervals.  
A monitored website is called a "check."  My library provides a Ruby wrapper for the Pingdom REST API, allowing 
users to create, modify, and delete checks as well as get information about one check or all checks.  
You will need a Pingdom account (email, password, and API key) in order to use this library.
